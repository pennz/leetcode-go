 *
 * Implement a MyCalendarTwo class to store your events. A new event can be
 * added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
 * 
 * Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this
 * represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of
 * real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
 * 
 * A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection
 * (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)
 * 
 * For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be
 * added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking.
 * Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 * Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();
 * MyCalendar.book(start, end)
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * MyCalendar();
 * MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
 * MyCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
 * MyCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
 * MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
 * MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
 * MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
 * Explanation: 
 * The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.
 * The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a
 * triple booking.
 * The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is
 * already double booked.
 * The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be
 * double booked with the third event;
 * the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be
 * double booked with the second event.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most
 * 1000.
 * In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the
 * range [0, 10^9].
 *
