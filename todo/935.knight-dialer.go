 *
 * A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
 * 
 * .           
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad
 * (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one
 * key to another numbered key.
 * 
 * Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight),
 * it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.
 * 
 * How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?
 * 
 * Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
