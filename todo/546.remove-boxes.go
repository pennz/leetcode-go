 *
 * Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive
 * numbers.
 * You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box
 * left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color
 * (composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k*k points.
 * Find the maximum points you can get.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
 * Output: 23
 * Explanation:
 * [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
 * ----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
 * ----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
 * ----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
 * ----> [] (2*2=4 points)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= boxes.length <= 100
 * 1 <= boxes[i]Â <= 100
