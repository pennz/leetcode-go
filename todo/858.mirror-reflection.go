 * Testcase Example:  '2\n1'
 *
 * There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.
 * Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the
 * remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.
 * 
 * The square room has walls of length p, and a laser ray from the southwest
 * corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.
 * 
 * Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is
 * guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: p = 2, q = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back
 * to the left wall.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= p <= 1000
 * 0 <= q <= p
 *
