 *
 * Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving
 * from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k
 * numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one
 * position. Return the max sliding window.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in linear time?
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
 * Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
 * Explanation: 
 * 
 * Window position                Max
 * ---------------               -----
 * [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 * ⁠1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 * ⁠1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 * ⁠1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 * ⁠1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 * ⁠1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
 *

 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 1 <= k <= nums.length
