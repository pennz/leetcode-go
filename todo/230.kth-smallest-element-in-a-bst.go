 *
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
 * smallest element in it.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
 * ⁠  3
 * ⁠ / \
 * ⁠1   4
 * ⁠ \
 * 2
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
 * ⁠      5
 * ⁠     / \
 * ⁠    3   6
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  2   4
 * ⁠ /
 * ⁠1
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
 * find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
 * routine?
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of elements of the BST is between 1 to 10^4.
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
