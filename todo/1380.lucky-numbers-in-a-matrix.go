 * Testcase Example:  '[[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]'
 *
 * Given a m * n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the
 * matrix in any order.
 * 
 * A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum
 * element in its row and maximum in its column.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
 * Output: [15]
 * Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row
 * and the maximum in its column
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
 * Output: [12]
 * Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row
 * and the maximum in its column.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
 * Output: [7]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == mat.length
 * n == mat[i].length
 * 1 <= n, m <= 50
 * 1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5.
 * All elements in the matrix are distinct.
