 *
 * Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the
 * non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero
 * sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the
 * smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val
 * = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.
 * 
 * Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the
 * set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.
 * 
 * If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ⁠   2
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   5
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   5   7
 * 
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ⁠   2
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   2
 * 
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest
 * value.
