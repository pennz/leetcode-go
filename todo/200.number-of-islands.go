 *
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
 * islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
 * adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
 * the grid are all surrounded by water.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [
 * ⁠ ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 * ⁠ ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 * ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ⁠ ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [
 * ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 * ⁠ ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 * ⁠ ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 * ]
 * Output: 3
