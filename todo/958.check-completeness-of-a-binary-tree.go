 *
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
 * 
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is
 * completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
 * possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level
 * h.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with
 * node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are
 * as far left as possible.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
