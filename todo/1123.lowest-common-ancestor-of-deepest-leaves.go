 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
 *
 * Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest
 * leaves.
 * 
 * Recall that:
 * 
 * 
 * The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
 * The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the
 * depth of each of its children is d+1.
 * The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the
 * largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3]
 * Output: [1,2,3]
 * Explanation: 
 * The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
 * The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
 * The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization
 * "[1,2,3]".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [4]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: [2,4,5]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
 * Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
