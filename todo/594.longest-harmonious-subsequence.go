 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]'
 *
 * We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its
 * maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
 * 
 * Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest
 * harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
