 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5]'
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 * 
 * Find the minimum element.
 * 
 * The array may contain duplicates.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,3,5]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
 * Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
