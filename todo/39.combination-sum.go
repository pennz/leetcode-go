 * Testcase Example:  '[2,3,6,7]\n7'
 *
 * Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a
 * target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the
 * candidate numbers sums to target.
 * 
 * The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of
 * times.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
 * A solution set is:
 * [
 * ⁠ [7],
 * ⁠ [2,2,3]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
 * A solution set is:
 * [
 * [2,2,2,2],
 * [2,3,3],
 * [3,5]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
 * 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
 * Each element of candidate is unique.
 * 1 <= target <= 500
