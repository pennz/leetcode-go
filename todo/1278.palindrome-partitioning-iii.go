 * Testcase Example:  '"abc"\n2'
 *
 * You are given a string s containing lowercase letters and an integer k. You
 * need to :
 * 
 * 
 * First, change some characters of s to other lowercase English letters.
 * Then divide s into k non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring
 * is palindrome.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide
 * the string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abc", k = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1
 * character in "ab" to make it palindrome.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabbc", k = 3
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them
 * are palindrome.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetcode", k = 8
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= k <= s.length <= 100.
 * s only contains lowercase English letters.
