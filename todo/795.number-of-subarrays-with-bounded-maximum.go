 * Testcase Example:  '[2,1,4,3]\n2\n3'
 *
 * We are given an array A of positive integers, and two positive integers L
 * and R (L <= R).
 * 
 * Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value
 * of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.
 * 
 * 
 * Example :
 * Input: 
 * A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
 * L = 2
 * R = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2,
 * 1], [3].
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * L, R  and A[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
 * The length of A will be in the range of [1, 50000].
