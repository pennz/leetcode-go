 * 
 * Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree
 * sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values
 * formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So
 * what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all
 * the values with the highest frequency in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Examples 1
 * Input:
 * 
 * ⁠ 5
 * ⁠/  \
 * 2   -3
 * 
 * return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them
 * in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Examples 2
 * Input:
 * 
 * ⁠ 5
 * ⁠/  \
 * 2   -5
 * 
 * return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit
 * signed integer.
