 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
 * This matrix has the following properties:
 * 
 * 
 * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Consider the following matrix:
 * 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
 * ⁠ [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
 * ⁠ [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
 * ⁠ [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
 * ⁠ [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Given target = 5, return true.
 * 
 * Given target = 20, return false.
