 * Testcase Example:  '"USA"'
 *
 * Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right
 * or not.
 * 
 * We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the
 * following cases holds:
 * 
 * 
 * All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
 * All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
 * Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
 * 
 * Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "USA"
 * Output: True
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "FlaG"
 * Output: False
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and
 * lowercase latin letters.
