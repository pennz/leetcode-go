 * Testcase Example:  '"eleetminicoworoep"'
 *
 * Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each
 * vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must
 * appear an even number of times.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two
 * each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "bcbcbc"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because
 * all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
 * sÂ contains only lowercase English letters.
