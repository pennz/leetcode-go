 * Testcase Example:  '3'
 *
 * There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs.
 * Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every
 * third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th
 * round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last
 * bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 1 
 * Explanation: 
 * At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
 * After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
 * After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
 * After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
 * 
 * So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
