 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]'
 *
 * In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B
 * or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)
 * 
 * Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the
 * average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both
 * non-empty.
 * 
 * 
 * Example :
 * Input: 
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both
 * of them have the average of 4.5.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The length of A will be in the range [1, 30].
 * A[i] will be in the range of [0, 10000].
