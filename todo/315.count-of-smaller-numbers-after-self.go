 * Testcase Example:  '[5,2,6,1]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts
 * array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of
 * smaller elements to the right of nums[i].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
 * Output: [2,1,1,0]
 * Explanation:
 * To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
 * To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
 * To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
 * To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * -10^4Â <= nums[i] <= 10^4
