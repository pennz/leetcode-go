 * 
 * 
 * ⁠It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. 
 * ⁠It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase
 * letter, and at least one digit. 
 * ⁠It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is
 * weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met). 
 * 
 * 
 * Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input,

 * already strong, return 0.
 *
