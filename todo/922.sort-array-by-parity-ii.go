 * Testcase Example:  '[4,2,5,7]'
 *
 * Given an array AÂ of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are
 * odd, and half of the integers are even.
 * 
 * Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is
 * even, i is even.
 * 
 * You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [4,2,5,7]
 * Output: [4,5,2,7]
 * Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been
 * accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= A.length <= 20000
 * A.length % 2 == 0
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 1000
