 * Testcase Example:  '[1,17,8]'
 *
 * Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for
 * every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
 * 
 * Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.Â  Two permutations
 * A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] !=
 * A2[i].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,17,8]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,2,2]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 12
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 1e9
