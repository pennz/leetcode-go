 *
 * Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such
 * that:
 * 
 * 
 * Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
 * The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order
 * traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has
 * 0 children.)
 * The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf
 * value in its left and right subtree respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum
 * of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a
 * 32-bit integer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [6,2,4]
 * Output: 32
 * Explanation:
 * There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the
 * second has non-leaf node sum 32.

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= arr.length <= 40
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 15
 * It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it
 * is less than 2^31).
