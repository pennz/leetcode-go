 * separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
 * 
 * A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and

 * 
 * You may return the list in any order.
 *

 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
 * Output: ["sweet","sour"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
 * Output: ["banana"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= A.length <= 200
 * 0 <= B.length <= 200
 * A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
