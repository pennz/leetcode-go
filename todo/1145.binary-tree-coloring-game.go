 *
 * Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root
 * of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and
 * each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
 * 
 * Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second
 * player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors
 * the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value
 * y blue.
 * 
 * Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn,
 * that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player
 * 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left
 * child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
 * 
 * If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must
 * pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the
 * winner is the player that colored more nodes.
 * 
 * You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure
 * you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from
 * 1 to n.
 * n is odd.
 * 1 <= x <= n <= 100
