 * Testcase Example:  '[-1,2,1,-4]\n1'
 *
 * Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers
 * in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three
 * integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 =
 * 2).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
 * -10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3
 * -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
 *
