 *
 * Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.
 * 
 * From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or
 * down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e.
 * wrap-around is not allowed).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = 
 * [
 * ⁠ [9,9,4],
 * ⁠ [6,6,8],
 * ⁠ [2,1,1]
 * ] 
 * Output: 4 
 * Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = 
 * [
 * ⁠ [3,4,5],
 * ⁠ [3,2,6],
 * ⁠ [2,2,1]
 * ] 
 * Output: 4 
 * Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally
 * is not allowed.
