 *
 * You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest
 * triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the
 * largest.
