 *
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and
 * T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to
 * identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 * 
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
 * occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 * 
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
