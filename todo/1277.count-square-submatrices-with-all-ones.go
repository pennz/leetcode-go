 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]'
 *
 * Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices
 * have all ones.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix =
 * [
 * [0,1,1,1],
 * [1,1,1,1],
 * [0,1,1,1]
 * ]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: 
 * There are 10 squares of side 1.
 * There are 4 squares of side 2.
 * There is  1 square of side 3.
 * Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = 
 * [
 * ⁠ [1,0,1],
 * ⁠ [1,1,0],
 * ⁠ [1,1,0]
 * ]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: 
 * There are 6 squares of side 1.  
 * There is 1 square of side 2. 
 * Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 300
 * 1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
 * 0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1
