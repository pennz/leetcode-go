 *
 * In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 
 * 
 * Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in
 * seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i, j
 * such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
 * (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
 * (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
 * (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [60,60,60]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is
 * divisible by 60.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= time.length <= 60000
 * 1 <= time[i] <= 500
