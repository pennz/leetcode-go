 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]'
 *
 * Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into
 * [1,6].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 * 
 * NOTE:Â input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to

 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1]
