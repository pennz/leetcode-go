 *
 * A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2
 * children.
 * 
 * Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element
 * of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
 * 
 * Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
 * 
 * You may return the final list of trees in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 7
 * Output:
 * [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
