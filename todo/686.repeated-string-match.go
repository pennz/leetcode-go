 * Testcase Example:  '"abcd"\n"cdabcdab"'
 *
 * Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be
 * repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
 * 
 * For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
 * 
 * Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a
 * substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times
 * ("abcdabcd").
 * 
 * Note:
 * The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
