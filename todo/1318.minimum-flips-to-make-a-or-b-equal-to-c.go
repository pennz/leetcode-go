 * Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in
 * some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
 * Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0
 * to 1 in their binary representation.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= a <= 10^9
 * 1 <= b <= 10^9
 * 1 <= c <= 10^9
