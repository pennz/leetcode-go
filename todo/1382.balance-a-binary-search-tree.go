 *
 * Given a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the
 * same node values.
 * 
 * A binary search tree is balanced if and only if the depth of the two
 * subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
 * 
 * If there is more than one answer, return any of them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
 * Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
 * Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2,null,null]
 * is also correct.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
 * The tree nodes will have distinct values between 1 and 10^5.
