 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4,7]'
 *
 * 
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1,
 * 3, 5, 7].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1,
 * and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is
 * guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
