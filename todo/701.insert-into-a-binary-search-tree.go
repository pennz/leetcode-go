 *
 * Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted
 * into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the
 * BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist
 * in the original BST.
 * 
 * Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as
 * the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.
 * 
 * For example, 
 * 
 * 
 * Given the tree:
 * ⁠       4
 * ⁠      / \
 * ⁠     2   7
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   1   3
 * And the value to insert: 5
 * 
 * 
 * You can return this binary search tree:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠        4
 * ⁠      /   \
 * ⁠     2     7
 * ⁠    / \   /
 * ⁠   1   3 5
 * 
 * 
 * This tree is also valid:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠        5
 * ⁠      /   \
 * ⁠     2     7
 * ⁠    / \   
 * ⁠   1   3
 * ⁠        \
 * ⁠         4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 0 and 10^4.
 * Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to -10^8, inclusive.
 * -10^8 <= val <= 10^8
 * It's guaranteed that val does not exist in the original BST.
