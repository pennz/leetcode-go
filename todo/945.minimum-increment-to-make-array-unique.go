 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2]'
 *
 * Given an array of integers A, a move consists of choosing any A[i], and
 * incrementing it by 1.
 * 
 * Return the least number of moves to make every value in A unique.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:  After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:  After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
 * It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to
 * have all unique values.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= A.length <= 40000
 * 0 <= A[i] < 40000
