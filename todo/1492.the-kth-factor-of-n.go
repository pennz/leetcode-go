 *
 * Given two positive integers n and k.
 * 
 * A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
 * 
 * Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the
 * kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 12, k = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 7, k = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, k = 4
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should
 * return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, k = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1000, k = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125,
 * 200, 250, 500, 1000].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= k <= n <= 1000
