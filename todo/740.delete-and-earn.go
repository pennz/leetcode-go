 *
 * Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
 * 
 * In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i]
 * points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i]
 * + 1.
 * 
 * You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by
 * applying such operations.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
 * Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: 
 * Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
 * Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
 * 9 total points are earned.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The length of nums is at most 20000.
 * Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].
