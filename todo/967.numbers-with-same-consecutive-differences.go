 * Testcase Example:  '3\n7'
 *
 * Return all non-negative integers of length N such that the absolute
 * difference between every two consecutive digits is K.
 * 
 * Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except for
 * the number 0 itself. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid,
 * but 0 is valid.
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 3, K = 7
 * Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
 * Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading
 * zeroes.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: N = 2, K = 1
 * Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= N <= 9
 * 0 <= K <= 9
