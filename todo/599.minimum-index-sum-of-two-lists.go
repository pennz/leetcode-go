 *
 * 
 * Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both
 * have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings. 
 * 
 * 
 * You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list
 * index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with
 * no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
 * ["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse",
 * "Shogun"]
 * Output: ["Shogun"]
 * Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
 * ["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
 * Output: ["Shogun"]
 * Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is
 * "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
 * The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
 * The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
 * No duplicates in both lists.
