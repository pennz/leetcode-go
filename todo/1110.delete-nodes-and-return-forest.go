 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n[3,5]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct
 * value.
 * 
 * After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a
 * forest (a disjoint union of trees).
 * 
 * Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the
 * result in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
 * Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
 * Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
 * to_delete.length <= 1000
 * to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.
