 *
 * Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the
 * pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference
 * between A and B. 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * nums = [1,3,1]
 * k = 1
 * Output: 0 
 * Explanation:
 * Here are all the pairs:
 * (1,3) -> 2
 * (1,1) -> 0
 * (3,1) -> 2
 * Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 2 .
 * 0 .
 * 1 .
