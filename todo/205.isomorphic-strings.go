 * Testcase Example:  '"egg"\n"add"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 * 
 * Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 * 
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
 * preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
 * character but a character may map to itself.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume both s and t have the same length.
