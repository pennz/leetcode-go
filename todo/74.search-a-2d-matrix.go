 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
 * This matrix has the following properties:
 * 
 * 
 * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
 * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the
 * previous row.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * matrix = [
 * ⁠ [1,   3,  5,  7],
 * ⁠ [10, 11, 16, 20],
 * ⁠ [23, 30, 34, 50]
 * ]
 * target = 3
 * Output: true
 *
