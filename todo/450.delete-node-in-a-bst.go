 *
 * Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the
 * given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of
 * the BST.
 * 
 * Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
 * 
 * Search for a node to remove.
 * If the node is found, delete the node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
 * key = 3
 * 
 * ⁠   5
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 3   6
 * ⁠/ \   \
 * 2   4   7
 * 
 * Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
 * 
 * One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.
 * 
 * ⁠   5
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 4   6
 * ⁠/     \
 * 2       7
 * 
 * Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

 * ⁠ 2   6
 * ⁠  \   \
 * ⁠   4   7
