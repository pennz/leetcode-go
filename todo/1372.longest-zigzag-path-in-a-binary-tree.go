 *
 * Given a binary tree root, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as
 * follow:
 * 
 * 
 * Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
 * If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the
 * current node otherwise move to the left child.
 * Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
 * Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node
 * has a length of 0).
 * 
 * Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left ->
 * right).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * Each tree has at most 50000 nodes..
 * Each node's value is between [1, 100].
