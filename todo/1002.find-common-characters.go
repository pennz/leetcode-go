 *
 * Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list
 * of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including
 * duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but
 * not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final
 * answer.
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order.

 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
 * Output: ["e","l","l"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
 * Output: ["c","o"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 100
 * 1 <= A[i].length <= 100
 * A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
