 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4]\n[1,2,3,7]'
 *
 * We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.
 * 
 * We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are
 * in the same index position in their respective sequences.
 * 
 * At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.
 * (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... <
 * A[A.length - 1].)
 * 
 * Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences
 * strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it
 * possible.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 
 * Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
 * A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * which are both strictly increasing.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range
 * [1, 1000].
 * A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].
