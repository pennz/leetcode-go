 *
 * Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is
 * a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals
 * the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
 * 
 * Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and
 * coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 2
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
