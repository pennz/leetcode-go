 * Testcase Example:  '[1,15,7,9,2,5,10]\n3'
 *
 * Given an integer array A, you partition the array into (contiguous)
 * subarrays of length at most K.  After partitioning, each subarray has their
 * values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.
 * 
 * Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], K = 3
 * Output: 84
 * Explanation: A becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= K <= A.length <= 500
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
 *
