 * Testcase Example:  '[1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of
 * its children is 2, and so on.
 * 
 * Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at
 * level X is maximal.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * Level 1 sum = 1.
 * Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
 * Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
 * So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the given tree is between 1 and 10^4.
 * -10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5
