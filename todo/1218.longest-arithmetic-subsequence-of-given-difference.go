 *
 * Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of
 * the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the
 * difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals
 * difference.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
 * -10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4
 *
