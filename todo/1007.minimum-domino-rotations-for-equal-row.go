 *
 * In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of
 * the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on
 * each half of the tile.)
 * 
 * We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the
 * same, or all the values in B are the same.
 * 
 * If it cannot be done, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do
 * any rotations.
 * If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the
 * top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: 
 * In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of
 * values equal.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6
 * 2 <= A.length == B.length <= 20000
