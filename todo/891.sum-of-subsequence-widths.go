 * Testcase Example:  '[2,1,3]'
 *
 * Given an array of integers A, consider all non-empty subsequences of A.
 * 
 * For any sequence S, let the width of S be the difference between the maximum
 * and minimum element of S.
 * 
 * Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A. 
 * 
 * As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,1,3]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].
 * The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
 * The sum of these widths is 6.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 20000
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 20000
