 *
 * Given an integer n. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which doesn't
 * contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
 * 
 * Return a list of two integers [A, B] where:
 * 
 * 
 * A and B are No-Zero integers.
 * A + B = n
 * 
 * 
 * It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many
 * valid solutions you can return any of them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: [1,1]
 * Explanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B don't contain any 0 in
 * their decimal representation.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 11
 * Output: [2,9]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10000
 * Output: [1,9999]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 69
 * Output: [1,68]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1010
 * Output: [11,999]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 10^4
