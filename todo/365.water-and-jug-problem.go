 *
 * You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite
 * amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is
 * possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.
 * 
 * If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water
 * contained within one or both buckets by the end.
 * 
 * Operations allowed:
 * 
 * 
 * Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
 * Empty any of the jugs.
 * Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full
 * or the first jug itself is empty.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
 * Output: True
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
 * Output: False
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= x <= 10^6
 * 0 <= y <= 10^6
 * 0 <= z <= 10^6
