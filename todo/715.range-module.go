 *
 * A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to
 * design and implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.
 * 
 * addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right),
 * tracking every real number in that interval.  Adding an interval that
 * partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in
 * the interval [left, right) that are not already tracked.
 * 
 * queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if and only if every real
 * number in the interval [left, right)
 * ‚Å†is currently being tracked.
 * 
 * removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently
 * being tracked in the interval [left, right).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * addRange(10, 20): null
 * removeRange(14, 16): null
 * queryRange(10, 14): true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)
 * queryRange(13, 15): false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not
 * being tracked)
 * queryRange(16, 17): true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked,
 * despite the remove operation)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * A half open interval [left, right) denotes all real numbers left .
 * 
 * 0 < left < right < 10^9 in all calls to addRange, queryRange, removeRange.
 * The total number of calls to addRange in a single test case is at most 1000.
 * The total number of calls to queryRange in a single test case is at most
 * 5000.
 * The total number of calls to removeRange in a single test case is at most
 * 1000.
