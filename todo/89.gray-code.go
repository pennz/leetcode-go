 *
 * The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ
 * in only one bit.
 * 
 * Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the
 * code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with
 * 0.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2
 * Output: [0,1,3,2]
 * Explanation:
 * 00 - 0
 * 01 - 1
 * 11 - 3
 * 10 - 2
 * 
 * For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
 * For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.
 * 
 * 00 - 0
 * 10 - 2
 * 11 - 3
 * 01 - 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 0
 * Output: [0]
 * Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
 * A gray code sequence of n has size = 2^n, which for n = 0 the size is 2^0 =
 * 1.
 * Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].
