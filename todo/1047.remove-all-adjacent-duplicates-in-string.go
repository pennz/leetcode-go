 * Testcase Example:  '"abbaca"'
 *
 * Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of
 * choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
 * 
 * We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
 * 
 * Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
 * It is guaranteed the answer is unique.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abbaca"
 * Output: "ca"
 * Explanation: 
 * For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent
 * and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is
 * that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final
 * string is "ca".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= S.length <= 20000
 * S consists only of English lowercase letters.
