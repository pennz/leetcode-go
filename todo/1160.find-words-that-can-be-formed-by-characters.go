 *
 * You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
 * 
 * A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each
 * character can only be used once).
 * 
 * Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 =
 * 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: 
 * The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 +
 * 5 = 10.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
 * All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
