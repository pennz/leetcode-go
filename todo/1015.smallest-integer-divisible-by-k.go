 *
 * Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N
 * such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.
 * 
 * Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= K <= 10^5
